    "text": " A purpose statement needs to state clearly that which the researcher hopes to determine/understand about the specific phenomenon being explored/investigated/considered. The terminology (explore/investigate/consider so that one can determine/understand) is typical of qualitative research. In qualitative research we do not attempt to prove something because qualitative research studies human experiences/phenomena in their natural environments. Qualitative research allows for some measure of subjectivity. The purpose statement indicates who (individuals/groups/communities) may benefit from the study. It indicates the type of study (qualitative/quantitative/mixed methods/practice-based/practice-led, ethnographic, autoethnographic, etc.), the strategy of inquiry (eg, case study, narrative inquiry, self-study, phenomenology, action research, etc). It anticipates the contribution that the study may make to the field of study."
